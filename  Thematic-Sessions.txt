Dynamical Systems Thematic Session
Friday, January 30, 2026
Coordenadores: Eduardo Leandro, Anete Soares, Thiago Dias e Marcelo Pedro


Preliminary Program:


9am - Clodoaldo Ragazzo (Universidade de São Paulo / Brazil)
Title: Dissipative Forces and Their Role in Celestial Mechanics
Abstract: This will be an introductory talk on how energy is dissipated in celestial systems. I will first explain tides, the main mechanism of energy loss in large bodies. Then I will show the main dynamical consequences of tides in simple two-body problems. Dissipative celestial mechanics aims to describe long transient behavior that leads to simple asymptotic states. These processes can be seen as multi-time-scale singular perturbation problems. However, the correct formulation of the problem is still an open question.


10am - Antonio Carlos Fernandes (Universidade Federal de Itajubá / Brazil)
Title: Stacked Central Configurations
Abstract: We will introduce some concepts related to the Newtonian N-body problem. The relation of particular solutions of this problem with central configurations. Next, we will recall the definition of a stacked central configuration, a concept introduced by Marshall Hampton in 2005. We will then present some results for stacked central configurations with N = 5 and general N.




11am- Ronaldo Garcia (Universidade Federal de Goiás / Brazil)
Title: Deformations of Hamiltonians and limit cycles.
Abstract: In this talk, it will be considered deformations of Hamiltonian systems, and the average theory will be applied to show the existence of isolated periodic orbits (limit cycles). Special attention will be paid to the coupled harmonic oscillators. In addition, some applications to the principal curvature lines will be explored.


2pm- Eduardo Leandro (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco / Brazil)
Title: Moments, Equilibrium Equations and Geometric Constraints
Abstract: We review the classical theory of moments and formulate its implications for problems of equilibrium configurations of systems of interacting particles. Our study assumes only that the interactions are between pairs of particles and are directed along the lines connecting each pair. The equilibrium equations obtained from the theory of moments include celebrated equations from Celestial Mechanics such as Albouy-Chenciner and Dziobek equations for central configurations. All equilibrium equations are geometric in character, as they are expressed only in terms of mutual distances between particles and volumes of subconfigurations. We shall also briefly discuss applications to constraints on mutual distances to ensure a configuration has a given dimension or is co-spherical.


3pm- Lei Zhao (Dalian University of Technology / China)
Title: Title: Billiards and Celestial Mechanics
Abstract: In recent years many links between celestial mechanics and billard-type problems have been studied in the research field of mechanical billiards, or billiards in a potential field. Several new integrable mechanical billiards have been identified and in the high energy regime many mechanical billiards in a Kepler potential field in the plane are shown to have chaotic dynamics. In this talk I will survey ideas for establishing integrability and chaos in these systems.

Sistemas Complexos em Física e Estatística
Friday, January 23, 2026
Coordenadores: Viviane e Paulo Duarte

Morning Session (9:00 – 12:30) — Foundations and Tools for Complex Systems

Block 1 — Mathematical and Computational Foundations

Topological Data Analysis: A Computer Scientist POV

Wilson de Oliveira

Departamento de Estatística e Informática, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,

Recife, PE

TDA is an applied branch of Algebraic Topology that deals with Data Science. Algebraic
Topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study
topological spaces. Topology is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties
of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations. The fact that TDA
ends up being useful to Data Science is rather surprising. For a Computer Scientist,
Statistician, or Data Scientist in general to come to grips with the field of TDA seems a
long, arduous path to follow. In this brief talk, I aim to demonstrate that there are shortcuts.
With examples and very few definitions, I try to convince non-mathematicians they can
safely use TDA and get encouraged to follow an introductory course on Algebraic
Topology for Data Science.

Weighted Permutation Entropy

Borko Stosic

Departamento de Estatística e Informática, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,

Recife, PE

Permutation entropy (PE) is a powerful and widely adopted method for assessing the
predictability and complexity of time series. While it is parameter free, classical PE treats
all ordinal patterns equally, which can obscure subtle dynamical structures by discarding
information carried by amplitude variations. Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE)
addressed this limitation by introducing weights derived from the data’s amplitude,
improving sensitivity to regime changes and outlier behavior. In this talk, I will describe the
recently introduced Generalized Weighted Permutation Entropy (GWPE) method, a unified
extension of both PE and WPE. GWPE broadens the framework by offering a tunable
balance between ordinal structure and amplitude information, allowing flexible weighting
schemes to enhance the effect of both small and large fluctuations. This generalization not
only preserves the interpretability and computational efficiency of PE but also provides a
richer lens to analyze predictability and complexity in nonlinear systems. I will outline the
theoretical foundation of GWPE, demonstrate its computation, and present illustrative
applications on synthetic systems and real-world datasets. The aim is to show how GWPE
captures fluctuation dynamics that standard PE and WPE may miss, and to highlight open
questions for applying GWPE in multi-scale and high-frequency data analysis.

Generalized Solving Differential Equations via Neural Networks

Tiago A. E. Ferreira

Departamento de Estatística e Informática, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,

Recife, PE

Differential equations can be used to model many scientific and engineering problems.
However, for many physical systems of practical interest, these differential equations are
analytically intractable. Consequently, there is great interest in developing computational
techniques to solve differential equations numerically. An artificial intelligence approach to
solving differential equations is based on Neural Networks. A Neural Network is a
computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. At its core,
it’s a system designed to recognize patterns and learn to process data in a way that
mimics human cognition. The basic principle for solving differential equations with Neural
Networks is to look at the problem as an optimization problem. Defining a differential
equation generically as , where D is the differential equation of interest, u is a possible
solution to D, and F is a known function. Let be the output of a Neural Network. If is a trial
solution for D, then the residual of this trial solution can be expressed as . The core idea is
to utilize the squared residual, , as the loss function during the Neural Network’s training
process, thereby reducing the problem of solving the differential equation to a minimization
problem.

Block 2 — Modeling and Pattern Recognition in Natural Systems

From Structure to Pattern: Modeling and Quantifying Complexity in Sargassum

Morphology and Distribution
Paulo Duarte Neto

Departamento de Estatística e Informática, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,

Recife, PE

This presentation explores the morphological and spatial complexity of Sargassum spp.
across individual to regional scales through an integrated computational approach. At the
individual level, we employ rule-based modeling via L-systems to simulate realistic growth
architectures of different Sargassum morphotypes, capturing topological constraints, apical
dominance, and branching variability. These simulations provide a generative framework
for testing hypotheses about developmental plasticity and environmental modulation of
form. At the regional scale, we apply multifractal analysis to segmented remote sensing

products of Sargassum strandings in the tropical Atlantic. The results reveal distinct
multifractal signatures among morphological patch types, suggesting scale-invariant
properties and heterogeneity in aggregation patterns potentially linked to hydrodynamic or
biological drivers. Together, these modeling and analysis strategies offer complementary
perspectives on the emergence of structural complexity in Sargassum systems,
contributing to a deeper understanding of active matter dynamics in coastal and oceanic
environments.

Use of statistical tools for developing and exploiting ocean color satellite data for

marine environmental purposes
Vincent Vantrepotte

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), IRD – Laboratoire d’Océanologie et
de Géosciences (LOG), Univ. Littoral Côte d’Opale, Univ. Lille, Wimereux, France.
Ocean color satellite observations provide access to a wide range of key biogeochemical
descriptors (phytoplankton biomass, particulate and dissolved matter, and associated
carbon stocks). These data, available continuously since 1997, offer spatial resolutions
ranging from 20 m to 1 km and quasi-daily temporal coverage, making it possible to study
marine ecosystems at multiple scales—from synoptic to local, from extreme events to
long-term changes. Interpreting the ocean color signal requires the development of
specific algorithms, relying on various approaches (simple empirical models or machine
learning-based methods). Similarly, exploiting the maps derived from satellite observations
requires the implementation of adapted analytical tools (time-series decomposition,
classifications, Self-Organizing Maps). This presentation will provide an overview of the
potential of ocean color observations for studying the impacts of climatic and
anthropogenic forcings on the marine environment, as well as the tools used.

Stochastic Dynamics in Complex Systems: From Quantum Chaos to Optical

Turbulence
Iván R. R. Gonzalez

School of Engineering, Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Universidad

Mayor, Santiago 7500994, Chile

and Centro Multidisciplinario de Física, Universidad Mayor, Camino la Pirámide 5750,

Huechuraba, Santiago, Chile

This presentation is situated within the school of mathematics of complex systems and
demonstrates how physical phenomena from two seemingly distinct domains—the
quantum dynamics in billiards and the propagation of light through turbulent media—reveal
common underlying principles when analyzed with stochastic tools. In particular, the
generalization of the Rayleigh stochastic process serves as a unifying framework that
enables the description of transitions between order and chaos through non-Gaussian
probability density functions and power spectral densities characterized by 1/f α -type laws.
In the context of quantum billiards, this approach provides a description of the transition
from integrable dynamics to chaotic regimes by extending Dyson’s Brownian motion
model. This extension captures phenomena such as energy level repulsion, the

emergence of composite distributions, and the appearance of freezing regimes associated
with multifractal structures. Similarly, in the study of optical turbulence, it is observed that
the propagation of light beams through heterogeneous flows generates erratic
displacements that do not conform to the Gaussian paradigm. Here, modeling via Weibull
processes and Burr Type XII distributions accounts for the presence of heavy tails and
extreme events, as well as the emergence of power spectra exhibiting 1/f α scaling under
conditions of strong spatial correlation. Both scenarios—quantum chaos and atmospheric
turbulence—demonstrate that the mathematics of stochastic processes not only provides a
common language for diverse phenomena but also offers predictive tools to understand
complex transitions. The connection between probability distributions and power spectra
reveals a shared structure in which clusterization intermittency and amplitude intermittency
coexist, illustrating the power of the stochastic approach as a bridge between theory and
experiment in complex systems.

Lunch

Afternoon Session (14:00 – 17:30) — Population and Collective Dynamics in Natural
Systems
Block 3 — Population Dynamics
Movement bias in asymmetric landscapes and its impact on population distribution

and critical habitat size
Pablo de Castro

ICTP South American Institute for Fundamental Research, Instituto de Física Teórica,

Universidade

Estadual Paulista – UNESP, São Paulo, Brazil

Ecologists have long investigated how demographic and movement parameters determine
the spatial distribution and critical habitat size of a population. However, most models
oversimplify movement behaviour, neglecting how landscape heterogeneity influences
individual movement. We relax this assumption and introduce a
reaction–advection–diffusion equation that describes population dynamics when
individuals exhibit space-dependent movement bias toward preferred regions. Our model
incorporates two types of these preferred regions: a high-quality habitat patch, termed
‘habitat’, which is included to model avoidance of degraded habitats like deforested
regions; and a preferred location, such as a chemoattractant source or a watering hole,
that we allow to be asymmetrically located with respect to habitat edges. In this scenario,
the critical habitat size depends on both the relative position of the preferred location and
the movement bias intensities. When preferred locations are near habitat edges, the
critical habitat size can decrease when diffusion increases, a phenomenon called the drift
paradox. Also, ecological traps arise when the habitat overcrowds due to excessive
attractiveness or the preferred location is near a low-quality region. Our results highlight
the importance of species-specific movement behaviour and habitat preference as drivers
of population dynamics in fragmented landscapes and, therefore, in the design of
protected areas [1].

Persistence of small populations facing seasonal resource variability

Viviane Moraes de Oliveira

Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Rua Manoel de

Medeiros, s/n Dois Irmãos, 52171-900 Recife, Brazil

Although rapid or recurrent fluctuations in resource availability are typical of natural
habitats, their demographic consequences for small populations have yet to be thoroughly
assessed. The present study aims to clarify how seasonal fluctuations in resource
availability and demographic stochasticity interact to influence the persistence of small
populations. Our analysis begins with a deterministic consumer–resource model driven by
seasonal forcing, from which we develop an individual-based stochastic simulation with
discrete generations to account for demographic and mutational variability. We
demonstrate how phase lags among multiple substitutable resources, or adaptive shifts in
metabolic allocation, can buffer extinction risk without changing average resource inputs.

Evolutionary Rescue
Paulo Roberto de Araújo Campos

Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50740-560 Recife, PE,

Brazil

Understanding how species adapt and survive amid the rapid environmental changes
driven by climate change has never been more urgent. We will introduce the foundations
of evolutionary theory and the concept of fitness landscapes, before turning to a critical
challenge: the idea of evolutionary rescue. We will examine the possibilities and limits of
adaptation in avoiding extinction through rapid evolutionary change, drawing on insights
from my recent work in mathematical modeling.

Block 4 — Collective Behavior, Pattern Emergence and Complex Interactions

Complexity of climate dynamics

Tatijana Stosic

Departamento de Estatística e Informática, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco,

Recife, PE

Understanding the complexity of climate dynamics is essential for improving predictive
models and resilience strategies in the face of increasing hydroclimatic extremes. This talk
presents advanced methods used to access the nonlinear and scale-dependent behavior
of climate variables: Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA), the
Fisher–Shannon Information Plane, and the Complexity–Entropy Causality Plane (CECP).
MFDFA is used to quantify long-range correlations, multifractality, and the contribution of
small/large fluctuations in time series. The Fisher–Shannon plane provides a joint
assessment of information content and disorder, enabling the identification of regimes with
high unpredictability and low structural complexity. CECP is used to characterize the
dynamical nature of the time series by mapping their position in the entropy–complexity
space, distinguishing stochastic and chaotic behaviors. Together, these methods offer a
robust framework for diagnosing the intrinsic variability and emergent patterns in climate
systems.

Hands-On with Collective Behavior: An Introductory Toolkit for Analyzing Animal

Groups
Fransisco C. B. Leal

Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Rua Manoel de

Medeiros, s/n Dois Irmãos, 52171-900 Recife, Brazil

In this talk, I present two tools for the quantitative analysis of active collective
systems—illustrated with experimental data from schools of Danio rerio. The goal is to
provide participants with a practical and conceptual introduction to methods widely used in
statistical physics and complex systems modeling.
1. Mean Square Displacement (MSD): I show how this classic tool allows us to classify
diffusion regimes—normal, superdiffusive, or subdiffusive—and reveal dynamic transitions
induced by factors such as population density. I apply MSD to demonstrate how individual
fish behavior changes as group size increases, exhibiting superdiffusion at low densities
and transitioning to more restricted diffusion in larger groups.
2. Levy Flight and Power Laws: I explain how to identify efficient search patterns through
the distribution of step lengths. I show that, under certain conditions, individual movements
follow truncated power laws, compatible with Lévy flights—a strategy optimized for
exploration in uncertain environments. I discuss statistical criteria for distinguishing these
patterns from Brownian motion and their biological significance.

Throughout the presentation, I emphasize best practices in data analysis, methodological
challenges, and physical interpretation of results.

Mixed-phase space of an active particle in experimental Lemon Billiards

Tiago Araújo Lima

Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Recife, PE
Billiards are flat cavities where a particle is free to move between elastic collisions with the
boundary. In chaos theory, these systems are simple prototypes. The conservative
dynamics of a billiard may vary from regular to chaotic, depending only on the shape of the
boundary. In this work, we experimentally investigated active particle-environment
interactions in Lemon Billiards. To achieve this, we develop an Arduino robot interacting
with the billiard table, which acts as our active particle, and control the shape of the Lemon
Billiard with a parameter γ ∈ [0, 0.5]. We experimentally confirm that the system’s
dynamics continuously change from regular γ = 0 to fully chaotic γ = 0.5, passing through
cases of mixed-phase space for intermediate values of γ. We also analyze the robot’s
sensitivity to the initial conditions using the phase space as a function of time and the
Lyapunov exponent to characterize the dynamics observed through the robot-environment
interaction. Furthermore, we introduced a methodology based on recurrence analysis to
compare numerical data with experimental data on a dynamical system. Numeric analyses
complement the experimental results, showing a significant concordance. Our
experimental setup presents an alternative method for measuring mixed-phase spaces in
a billiard system outside the scope of optical physics. The robot-environment interaction
provides an excellent alternative platform for experimental studies in physical systems,
including additional aspects of chaos and dynamical systems such as confined self-
propelled particles and self-avoiding active particles.

Speaker 1: Anne Caroline Bronzi (UNICAMP)
Title: On the well-posedness of a generalized doubly parabolic Keller-Segel system with fractional diffusion
Abstract:
In this talk, we will analyze a doubly parabolic Keller-Segel system in the whole space R^d, d ≥ 2, where both cellular and chemical diffusion are governed by fractional Laplacians with
distinct exponents. This system generalizes the classical Keller-Segel model by introducing
superdiffusion, a form of anomalous diffusion. This extension accounts for nonlocal diffusive
effects observed in experimental settings, particularly in environments with sparse targets. We will present results on the local and global well-posedness of mild solutions for this generalized system under suitable conditions on the initial data in L^p(R^d). Additionally, we will characterize the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. This is a joint work with Crystianne
Andrade (IMECC, Unicamp).

Speaker 2: Marko Antonio Rojas Medar (UTA, Chile)
Title: Theoretical Insights into Second-Grade Fluids

Abstract:
In this talk, we present some of the problems we are currently investigating concerning the equations governing second-grade fluids. In particular, on the temporal decay, we characterize the decay rate of solutions for the second-grade fluid equations in terms of the decay character of the initial data. Furthermore, by imposing slightly more regularity on the initial data, we investigate the large-time behavior of these solutions and compare them to the solutions of the linearized equations.

Speaker 3: Sandra Imaculada Moreira Neto (UEMA)
Title: Quasilinear elliptic problems with exponential growth via the Nehari manifold method:
Existence of nonnegative and nodal solutions

Abstract:
In this talk, we address the existence of solutions for the quasilinear Schrödinger-type problem $$-\Delta u - \dfrac{1}{2}\Delta(a(x)u^2)u + V(x)u = f(u), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^2,$$
where $V$ is a continuous potential and $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a superlinear
function with either exponential subcritical or exponential critical growth. Our main analytical
tool is the Nehari manifold method, which we employ to establish the existence of
nonnegative solutions as well as nodal solutions. The results extend and complement classical contributions on quasilinear Schrödinger equations obtained via the Nehari method,
particularly those of Jia-quan Liu, Ya-qi Wang, and Zhi-Qiang Wang, by considering
nonlinearities of exponential type in two dimensions.

Speaker 4: Alânnio Barbosa Nobrega (UFCG)
Title: Existence and Multiplicity of solutions for a class of Dirac equations

Abstract:
In this talk, we present recent results on the existence and multiplicity of semiclassical
solutions for nonlinear Dirac equations involving continuous potentials and general nonlinear
self-couplings. In the first part, we consider a class of nonlinear Dirac equations with a small
parameter \( \varepsilon &gt; 0 \), where the nonlinearity depends on the modulus of the
solution. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the number of solutions is at least the
number of global minima of the potential function \( V \), provided \( \varepsilon \) is
sufficiently small. In the second part, assuming that the external potential attains a local
minimum, we relate the topological complexity of the set of minimum points to the
multiplicity of solutions. The main tools include variational methods and the Lusternik--
Schnirelmann category, combined with a penalization technique to handle the strongly
indefinite nature of the associated energy functional. Both problems are motivated by the rich structure and analytical challenges posed by the Dirac operator, particularly in the
semiclassical regime. Our results contribute to the understanding of nonlinear spinorial models by establishing existence and multiplicity theorems in settings with minimal regularity and without symmetry assumptions.

Speaker 5: Jefferson Abrantes dos Santos (UFCG)
Title: Global multiplicity of positive solutions for a sublinear elliptic equation in RN

Abstract:
We establish global multiplicity of positive solutions (existence and nonexistence theory) for a sublinear elliptic equation in RN with mass zero. In order to obtain our results we use a
combination of the sub- super solution method and variational techniques. For instance, we
need to implement a relevant result of type D^{1,2}(RN) versus X local minimizer for some
appropriate space X. This is joint work with Minbo Yang (Zhejiang Normal University), Pedro
Ubilla (USACH) and Jiazheng Zhou (UnB).

Speaker 6: Evelina Shamarova (UFPB)
Title: Singular solutions to k-Hessian equations with fast-growing nonlinearities

Abstract:
We study a class of elliptic problems, involving a k-Hessian and a very fast-growing
nonlinearity, on a unit ball. We prove the existence of a radial singular solution and obtain its exact asymptotic behavior in a neighborhood of the origin. Furthermore, we study the multiplicity of regular solutions and bifurcation diagrams. Na essential ingredient of this study
is analyzing the number of intersection points between the singular and regular solutions for rescaled problems. In the particular case of the exponential nonlinearity, we obtain the convergence of regular solutions to the singular and analyze the intersection number
depending on the parameter k and the dimension d. This talk is based on joint work with João Marcos do Ó and Esteban da Silva.

Speaker 7: Diego Ferraz (UFRN)
Title: Positive ground states for integrodifferential Schrödinger-Poisson systems
Abstract:
This talk presents existence results for positive solutions to a Schrödinger-Poisson system driven by a general class of integrodifferential operators. The system allows for two distinct operators whose parameter orders can be chosen freely under a mild coupling condition. The nonlinearity is of a pure power type, with a growth exponent in a range determined by these orders. Our argument is variational, based on a minimization over a Nehari-Pohozaev
manifold. We establish a maximum principle to guarantee the solution&#39;s positivity, and show
that for the specific case of the fractional Laplacian, this positive solution is also a ground state.

Speaker 8: Pedro Ubilla (USACH-Chile)

Title: Perturbations that transform the critical Brezis-Nirenberg problem into a supercritical
one.

Abstract:
We analyze perturbations of the classical Brezis–Nirenberg problem that turn the equation
into a supercritical one. While the original critical formulation admits no solutions in certain
cases, the perturbed version generates positive radial solutions. In dimensions greater than or equal to three, this mechanism produces solutions in parameter ranges where nonexistence was expected. This is a joint work with Luiz Faria (UFJF-Brasil) and Jeferson Silva (UFOP-Brasil).
